# GPR construction website

> Created as an example site to display my knowledge regarding React JS.
> For this website, I aimed to bring external libraries in to further add to the site as well as my knowledge on JS.
> This site will be used commercially, soon, which is why the site is still being worked on from many angles.

*Implemented the use of react-bootstrap as well as emailJS to create a professionally aesthetic experience*
